# Pok√©mon Emerald Postgame

This is a fun project I decided to take on to add a post-game like story
following your crowning as the new champion of Hoenn. I felt like there
wasn't a whole lot to do between beating the Elite 4 and the massive grind
it takes to get to Steven's battle. While this doesn't make it all the way
there, probably still have about 10 levels to go, this should hopefully 
make such a grind more enjoyable haha. I also felt like your rival character
gets pushed to the side pretty early, and doesn't interact much with you
after Lilycove city. Thus, I wanted to do a bit more with them in the story.

This "expansion" is made specifically so that you can take a vanilla save
file from your playthrough of Emerald and seemlessly transition to playing
on the expanded version. You SHOULD NOT start a new game on this expansion.
To make this work I needed to recycle trainer flags as there wouldn't have 
been enough for me, so only use this after beating the game on a vanilla
copy of Emerald. 

To start your journey, you need to have beaten the Elite 4 and then head
to Lilycove City. There you'll notice something a bit out of place. 

I built this while learning so my design choices are definitely a product
of learning as I went. Sorry about that.

Specifically, this expansion includes:
A new Route, 135
A new island dubbed Fabled Island after one of the islands you can reach
in ORAS. 
Fun Pokemon on the island to find (fun is probably subjective)
Hidden items on the island to help your journey. Specifically, the 5 
berries that raise your stats in a pinch are hidden on the island

Be prepared as Fabled Island has an unusual difficulty challenge I've
always wanted to see in a Pokemon game but hasn't been replicated I think.
Hopefully you'll find it fun too, and if not I'm really sorry. 

Big shoutout to Ekat for his Nosepass Spring tileset. Art is not my specialty
and so being able to borrow from that was a huge help.

Shoutout to GameFreak for making such a cool game. I loved looking in the
code and figuring out how they did so many crazy things. Heck, the way they
made maps and how small the tilesets are was crazy. I had to remake the 
Fabled Island tileset a few times to fit everything I wanted. Also the fact
this game is 8MB is crazy to me. They were crazy efficient.

Well that's enough from me, thank you for checking this out and I hope 
you enjoy playing it!
